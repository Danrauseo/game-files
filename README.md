There are a lot of files here, I apologise! 

This is an RPG based on the JavaScript tutorial on the FreeCodeCamp Website - just thought I'd should raise this! 

However, as you can see I have built on it HEAVILY. I apologise for the side of the project and it could definitely do with some cleaning up.

Co-Pilot has been a MASSIVE help in this project, but I've tried to lean on it as little as possible.
